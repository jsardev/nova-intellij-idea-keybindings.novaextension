# IntelliJ IDEA Key Bindings for Nova
---
Port of IntelliJ IDEA key bindings for Nova.

> **IMPORTANT NOTE**: This extension has only a few keybindings attached (those which I use personally). If you want to have additional ones supported, [feel free to contribute](https://github.com/sarneeh/nova-intellij-idea-keybindings.novaextension).

## Usage
1. Go to **Settings**
2. Go to **Key Bindings**
3. Choose **IntelliJ IDEA** from the Key Bindings Set
